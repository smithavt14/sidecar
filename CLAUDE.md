# CLAUDE.md — working on sidecar's own code

For *driving* sidecar as an agent (reviewing a document with a human), see
[skills/sidecar/SKILL.md](skills/sidecar/SKILL.md). This file is about changing sidecar itself.

## Shape

No build step. Six files carry the whole tool:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `server.js` | HTTP server + fs-watch → SSE. Boots express; dispatches `sidecar <verb>` to the CLI first. |
| `lib/cli.js` | The agent's entire command surface. Every write verb funnels into one `applyItems()`. |
| `lib/review.js` | Load/save/merge the `.review.json`. Shared by the server and the CLI so both merge identically. |
| `lib/wait.js` | `sidecar wait` — the fs-watching reactive-loop primitive. Server-independent by design. |
| `public/index.html` | The entire frontend: rendering, contenteditable editor, review rail. |
| `public/anchor.js` | The ONE content-anchor matcher, loaded by both the browser and Node. |

`public/anchor.js` and `lib/review.js` are shared on purpose. A second implementation of matching or
merging is a second set of bugs, and the two sides must agree byte-for-byte — a matcher that
normalised differently on each side once made the highlight point at one duplicate while accept
spliced another.

## Testing

```bash
npm test      # end-to-end against a real server + temp fixture repo, plus CLI and unit coverage
```

The CLI tests run the real binary with **no server running**, which is the point: the filesystem is
the sync layer, and the agent's interface has to work without one.

## The trap: a running server holds stale code

Editing `server.js`, `lib/`, or `public/` does not affect a server that is already running. You will
be testing against code loaded hours ago — this exact trap produced a whole "false orphan" debugging
session once. `sidecar doctor` compares the running server's code stamp against the code on disk and
prints **STALE** when they differ. Restart before testing.

The stamp (`<git-sha> · <mtime>`) is logged at boot, shown in `/api/state`, and on the wordmark's
hover title in the UI.

## Conventions

- Comments explain *why*, especially where the code looks odd — most of them record a real incident.
  Keep that when you change the surrounding code; delete them when the reason stops being true.
- Safety properties that tests cover and should stay covered: atomic sidecar writes, merge-by-id never
  dropping the other side's work, decided statuses never regressing, path confinement to the served
  root, Host-header allowlisting, DOMPurify on rendered markdown, `git diff` run without a shell.
