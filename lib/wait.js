/* sidecar — `sidecar wait <file>`: the reactive-loop primitive (P1), now watch/presence/timeout
   plumbing over lib/digest.js (P2).

   Moved verbatim out of server.js when the CLI grew its other verbs (lib/cli.js). Deliberately
   server-independent: it fs-watches the files directly, so it works with nothing running. The only
   thing it talks to a server about is decorative presence.

   The digest is no longer an in-memory delta of one wake — it seeds its baseline FROM the persisted
   cursor (lib/digest.js), so `wait` blocks until something the agent HASN'T SEEN, not just something
   that happens after launch. Consequence: launched with an unseen backlog it returns immediately with
   it. It shares one renderer with `sidecar digest`, and advances the cursor on a digest-emitting exit
   (never on a timeout exit). No cursor present → baseline is the current state → old behavior (wake on
   the next change). */

/* `sidecar wait --dir <folder>` — one process over every document in a folder.

   Same contract as the single-document wait, read a folder at a time: it blocks until something the
   agent has not seen lands on ANY document in the folder, prints one digest labelled per document,
   and exits 0. Timeout exits 1 and advances nothing. A path that is not a folder, or a folder this
   agent is already watching, exits 2.

   Everything underneath is the per-document machinery, run once per document: the cursor is still
   `<doc>.sidecar.seen.json`, the baseline is still `<doc>.sidecar.seen.base.<agent>`, and a cursor
   only advances for a document that actually contributed to the digest that was printed. So a folder
   wait and a per-document wait can be swapped for each other mid-review and neither replays nor
