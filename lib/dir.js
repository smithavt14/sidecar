/* sidecar — the DIRECTORY layer under `sidecar wait --dir` and `sidecar digest --dir`.

   Reviewing a product means reviewing a FOLDER: a brief, a research report, a business case. Per
   document that was one `wait` process each, three background watchers juggled for one review, and
   three digests the agent had to stitch together itself. `--dir` is one watcher and one digest over
   the whole folder.

   It is an AGGREGATION LAYER and nothing else. Every cursor stays exactly where it was — one
   `<doc>.sidecar.seen.json` per document, keyed by agent (lib/digest.js) — so a folder wait and a
   per-document wait read and advance the same markers, and switching between them loses nothing. A
   directory-level cursor would have been a second store to keep honest, and the first time the two
   disagreed the agent would have replayed or skipped a turn.

   Three things live here: which files a folder's review consists of, how several per-document
   digests read as one, and the lock that stops two folder watchers fighting over the same cursors.
   All of it is pure except `docsIn` (a readdir) and the lock (a file in tmp). */

// ---------- the doc set ----------

// The same folder the PANEL shows (server.js /api/dir): every document directly in it, no recursion,
// no dotfiles, nothing outside the `docKind` allowlist that already gates the picker, the watcher and
// every CLI verb. One definition means the agent watches exactly the rows the human sees.
//
// `require` is deliberately lazy: lib/cli.js requires this module, and its own `module.exports` is
// assigned at the bottom of the file, so a top-level require here would capture an empty object.
// Sorted by name so a digest lists documents in one order rather than the readdir's.

}

// ---------- the aggregate digest ----------

// Several per-document deltas (lib/digest.js computeDigest) as one report. `results` is EVERY
// document in the folder, in order, each `{ rel, d }`; this filters, because the count of documents
// with something to say is only meaningful against the count of documents looked at.
//
// The per-document renderer is reused for the body of each section (digestBody), so a line means the
// same thing here as it does in a single-document digest. What differs is the frame: a heading per
// document, and one DONE for the folder.
//
// DONE is true only when EVERY document is marked done, because that is the question the loop asks —
// "may I stop watching this folder?" — and one finished document does not answer it. The partial
// count rides along by name so the agent can see the review closing without opening anything.

// ---------- the lock ----------

// One folder watcher per agent. Two of them share every cursor in the folder, so whichever advances
// one first decides what the other believes it has already seen, and the human gets answered twice or
// not at all — the same reason a second `hq wait` refuses.
//
// The lock covers DIRECTORY waits only, and a per-document `wait` inside the folder coexists with one.
// Three reasons, and the third is the honest one: a per-document wait writes no lock today and has to
// keep behaving byte-for-byte as it does, so it can neither refuse nor be detected; the failure this
// prevents is folder-wide (two heartbeats claiming presence on every document, two watchers racing
// every cursor in it); and one overlapping per-document wait costs one doubled digest on one document,
// which self-heals because the cursor it advances is the same file both processes read.
//
// It lives in tmp rather than beside the documents: it is machine-local and dies with the process,
// unlike the cursor, and a lock file in the folder is a new artifact nobody's .gitignore covers.
