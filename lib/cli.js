/* sidecar — the agent's command surface.

   Before this existed, an agent drove sidecar by hand-editing <file>.sidecar.json: read the whole
   file, merge its change in memory, write the whole file back, for EVERY comment and reply. That
   cost ~1.7k tokens per item on a 3.5KB sidecar (and grew with the review), and the merge discipline
   it required was the longest, most failure-prone section of the docs. Every verb here funnels into
   applyItems(), which runs the same lib/review.js merge the HTTP server runs.

   Design rules:
   - The VERB is the kind. No --kind flag; `comment`/`flag`/`suggest`/`answer` say it themselves.
   - The CLI derives everything mechanical: id, by, at (real clock), status, and the anchor nesting.
     An agent cannot mis-stamp a timestamp or forget a field, because it never writes them.
   - Anchors are validated BEFORE writing. A quote that matches nothing, or matches several spans
     without an explicit --occurrence, is refused loudly instead of silently anchoring wrong.
   - Accept and reject are absent on purpose. Those are the human's, through the UI. The agent
     proposes; it never decides. */

Give your agent the protocol:

The loop, if you are the agent (full protocol: sidecar skill):
  export SIDECAR_AGENT=<your name>   codex, cursor, claude: the name the human sees on your cards
  sidecar doctor /abs/doc.md         is a server up, and the URLs to hand the human
  sidecar comment | suggest ...      raise things on the document
  sidecar wait /abs/doc.md           BLOCKS until the human acts, then prints what they did
  respond, then run wait again       nothing reaches you except through wait; stop at DONE: true

Commands (every one takes the document as its first argument):
  doctor    is a server running, on what code, is this install current, which URLs to hand over
  show      the complete review state          check     do all anchors still resolve
  comment   ask about a span                   flag      the same, marked as blocking
  suggest   propose a replacement              answer    answer a comment with an edit
  reply     add to a thread                    resolve   close a thread you opened
  reanchor  move an item to a new quote        drop      remove items
  add       write several items from JSON on stdin
  wait      block until the human acts         digest    what changed since you last looked
  elements  list what an .html asset offers to anchor to

Taking no document (they are about the machine, not one review):
  watchers  every armed wait, and whether its process is still alive
            --clean removes the records of the dead ones, --kill <pid> stops a live one

Reviewing a folder rather than one document? wait and digest take --dir <folder> instead of a file:
one watcher over every document in it, one digest labelled per document.

wait blocks for 15 minutes by default; --timeout <seconds> changes it and --timeout 0 removes the
backstop entirely.

An .html asset is reviewed as a rendered visual: it is read-only, and comment/flag anchor to an
element with --element <ref> (a data-sc value, #id, or [data-sc=…]) instead of --quote.

comment and reply take --image <path> (repeatable) to attach a screenshot.

Every verb prints its own usage when called wrong. Full protocol: sidecar skill`;
