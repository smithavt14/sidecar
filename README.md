# **A better way to work on documents with your AI agent.**

![Reviewing a document in sidecar: a suggestion card with a word-level diff, and a comment thread](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smithavt14/sidecar/main/docs/example.png)

Reviewing a document your agent drafted can be clumsy. The file lives on your disk, the conversation about it lives in a chat window, and marking up raw markdown by hand is annoying. 

The tools actually built for review, like Google Docs and Notion, do it well, but they live in the cloud. Your agent only reaches them through a connector, every change crosses the network, and your document sits on someone else's server. 

Sidecar brings the review to the file instead: suggestion cards, word-level diffs, and comment threads you can drop a screenshot into, on the markdown already on your disk. 100% local, and as modern as any SaaS tool.

**Why sidecar**

- **100% local.** No upload, no network requests, no account. The files on your disk are the whole system.
- **Real files, real diffs.** Edits write the actual markdown, and untouched blocks keep their exact original bytes, so `git diff` shows just what changed, and git is your undo.
- **Any agent with a shell.** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and the rest. One small CLI, no plugin, no API key.
- **A live loop, not a mailbox.** Your agent can watch the review and answer inside your comment threads the moment you act, and the thread shows _claude is replying_ while the answer is being written.
- **Anchored to content, not line numbers.** If text moves, anchors follow; if it's gone, the item goes orphaned, loudly, instead of editing the wrong place.
- **Cheap turns.** After the first read, your agent sees only what changed since its last look, so a long review doesn't mean re-reading the document every turn.
- **Mobile friendly.** One `tailscale serve` line puts the review on your phone over your own tailnet, where a comment can carry the screenshot you just took.

**When not to use it:** multi-user editing (this app is single-user by design), non-markdown files, or a review synced across two machines mid-flight.

## Quickstart

Start here. You can copy and paste this in your project directory:

```bash
npx skills add smithavt14/sidecar
```

That installs the skill where your agent looks for it. Now tell your agent *"review draft.md in
sidecar"*, and it fetches the tool, starts the server, and opens the review at
[localhost:4880](http://localhost:4880). Node ≥ 20; nothing else to set up.

To run the server yourself instead:

```bash
npm i -g @spktr/sidecar          # or prefix everything with npx @spktr/sidecar
sidecar ~/path/to/your/docs      # a single file or a whole directory
sidecar help                     # every command
sidecar skill                    # the agent protocol, on stdout, no install
```

Behind *"review draft.md in sidecar,"* your agent runs commands like:

```bash
sidecar suggest draft.md \
  --quote "ship all six features in week one" \
  --replacement "ship the three core features" \
  --note "Overcommit."
```

…and the card appears in your browser, live, as a diff with accept/reject. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
for the full command set.

Each turn your agent reads a digest rather than the document: the decisions you made with your reasons, new comments and replies in full, and the document's changed hunks. Reviewing this README, the file runs about 8,800 characters while the digests ran between 180 and 1,800. The first look of a session is still a full read; everything after it just costs whatever has changed.

**Review on your phone** (optional): `tailscale serve --bg 4880` proxies sidecar onto your private
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) tailnet. The picture button opens your camera roll there, so a comment
can carry the screenshot you just took. Tailnet-only: sidecar has no auth, so never `tailscale funnel`
it publicly.

## The loop

1. Your agent drafts a markdown file (or you open one of yours).
2. It seeds the review with suggestion cards and comments anchored to real text.
3. You read, accept, reject, reply, and edit rich text in place. Desk or phone.
4. The agent, backgrounded on `sidecar wait`, answers the moment you act, proposing rewrites right
   inside your comment threads. While it composes, the thread it's answering shows a quiet
   *claude is replying*, which clears as each reply lands.
5. You click **done reviewing** → the agent makes one commit. The dirty diff *was* the review state.

## What you can do

**Edit.** The rendered document *is* the editor.
- **Type-to-format:** `#`/`##`/`###` + space for headings, `-`/`1.` for lists, `>` for a quote, ` ``` `
  for a code block, and inline `**bold**` / `*italic*` / `` `code` `` as you type. Type `## ` in front of
  an existing heading to re-level it.
- **Block styles:** highlight text, then the toolbar's text-style dropdown converts the block between body
  text and H1 / H2 / H3.
- Select text for a floating toolbar: bold, italic (⌘B/⌘I), link, comment.

**Comment.** Select text, then comment. The comment box is draggable, so you can move it off the text you're
commenting on. Threads reply and resolve. Every open comment or suggestion softly highlights its span in the
document; tap the highlight to open its card, tap a card's quote to jump to the text. The review rail has two tabs: **active** threads (open, editable) and **archived** threads (settled, read-only).

**Screenshots.** Paste or drop an image into any comment or reply box, or use the picture button beside
**resolve**; click it to see it full size. Showing a broken layout beats describing one. Your agent can
attach images with `--image` and read the ones you attach, so *"here's what it does at 375px"* is a
thing you can hand it directly. They live as files in `<doc>.review.assets/` next to the review, so they
commit with the document and delete with it.

**Suggest** (your agent). Suggestion cards propose a replacement for a quoted span, shown as a word-level
diff. Accept applies it to the real file; reject leaves it.

**Show a flow, and comment on it.** A ` ```flow ` fence renders as a diagram, and clicking a box opens a
comment thread on *that step* rather than on the line of markdown describing it, which is usually the
thing you actually wanted to say. `A --> B` is an edge, `-->|label|` labels it, `{…}` is a decision, a
leading `LR` turns it sideways. The source stays plain text in your file, so it still reads in a
`git diff`. Raw HTML renders too (inline styles only), and relative image paths like `![](./wireframe.svg)` resolve against the document.

**Save.** Edits autosave to the real file (debounced), preserving the exact bytes of every block you didn't
touch.

## Safety mechanics

Hardened for exactly its threat model, which is single-user, single-machine, localhost, and no auth:

- Binds to `127.0.0.1` and validates the `Host` header against an allowlist (`SIDECAR_HOSTS`), because
  loopback binding alone doesn't stop DNS rebinding.
- Rendered markdown is sanitized with DOMPurify, so a hostile `<img onerror>` in a file can't execute.
- File access is confined to the served directory (path-traversal guarded), and `git diff` runs without a
  shell, so a crafted filename can't inject commands.
- Sidecar writes are atomic and merge by id; saves take an optimistic lock (409 on a stale file) and never
  silently clobber changes made on disk.

Single-machine matters: finish a review before syncing clones. Merge-by-id reconciles concurrent writes
to one file, not two divergent histories. (The agent also keeps a `<file>.review.seen.json` cursor of what
it has read and a `<file>.review.seen.base.<agent>` copy of the doc as of its last look, which its digest
diffs against. That is local agent state rather than review content; gitignore both as `*.review.seen*`.)

## Development

To hack on sidecar itself, clone and run from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smithavt14/sidecar && cd sidecar
npm install
npm start -- ~/path/to/your/docs      # → http://localhost:4880
npm test                              # end-to-end tests against a real server + temp fixture repo, plus round-trip/anchor units
```

It's a ~3,800-line tool with no build step: `public/index.html` is the whole frontend, `server.js` the
whole backend. The shared matcher (`public/anchor.js`) and serializer (`public/serialize.js`) run in both
the browser and Node, so the tests exercise the real logic.
